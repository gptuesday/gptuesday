    eventDescription: `This talk is about a simple idea: Everyone should be able to use AI to make cool stuff.
    
  When I started making crewAI, a framework to build AI Agents, I didn't know just how much it would change the way I work. This isn't just a chat about building AI Agents; it's a story about how these tools helped us grow our business and how they can help you too.
    
  I'll share our adventure with crewAI, showing how we used AI to solve problems, save time, and come up with new ideas. It's a journey of discovery and making things better with AI, showing everyone that they can use AI in their work and projects.`
