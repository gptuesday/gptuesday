    Vector Search is a powerful technique used in the field of AI, particularly in the realm of machine learning. It involves converting data into high-dimensional vectors and using these vectors to search for similar data points. This method is highly efficient and accurate, making it a popular choice for tasks such as image recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.

    eventDescription: `This talk is about a simple idea: Everyone should be able to use AI to make cool stuff.
    
  When I started making crewAI, a framework to build AI Agents, I didn't know just how much it would change the way I work. This isn't just a chat about building AI Agents; it's a story about how these tools helped us grow our business and how they can help you too.
    
  I'll share our adventure with crewAI, showing how we used AI to solve problems, save time, and come up with new ideas. It's a journey of discovery and making things better with AI, showing everyone that they can use AI in their work and projects.`
